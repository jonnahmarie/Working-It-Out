# Working It OUt

## Description
This is an application that allows a user to view, create, and track daily workouts. It was created using a Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and enables handle routes with Express.

Application was deployed on Heroku using MongoDB Atlas, however connecting MongoDB to the Heroku application is a process I have yet to accomplish, so I recommend installing and running the application via your local machine with instructions below.

## Installation

### From your local machine
- Clone the repository, then in order to run, install the dependencies by typing in your terminal:
```
npm install
```
Then run the server by:
```
npm start
```
In your web browser, search for:
```
localhost:3000
```

### From the deployed web application
No installation is necessary. Please access the deployed app by visiting: [https://guarded-cove-82204.herokuapp.com/](https://guarded-cove-82204.herokuapp.com/)
